<p>EQParseTables exists to turn the forum output from GamParse into tables of various formats in order to facilitate easy comparison.</p>

<p>Noticing that a_cleric03 is casting way more spells than you and getting showered with phatlewtz and the adoration of the tanks? No problem! Fire up EQParseTables and instantly compare your cast counts itemized by spell. Geek out over the breakdown of various spell types in beautiful stacked bar graphs and see exactly who's doing what.</p>

<p>If you've ever wanted to take a game way too seriously, EQParseTables can help you make that dream come true!</p>

<h2>
<a id="using-eqparsetables" class="anchor" href="#using-eqparsetables" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Using EQParseTables</h2>

<p>For the time being, EQParseTables is a console application. You'll need to paste the forum output from GamParse into a file and point the script at it. For example, if you save your parse summary as healparse.txt, you'd call </p>

<p><code>$ python3 eqparsetables.py healparse.txt</code></p>

<p>from the command line. For your convenience, EQParseTables looks for data in a file called parse.txt if no path is given.</p>

<h3>
<a id="combining-parses" class="anchor" href="#combining-parses" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Combining Parses</h3>

<p>It is also possible to combine cast parses from multiple sources into one in order to get more accurate results. Given the nature of logging in EQ and the data output by GamParse, EQParseTables uses a relatively naive method of combining data from multiple sources. For each spell cast, the highest cast count is taken for each player. For example, given two input sources containing</p>

<pre><code>[B]Combined: An enraged lemming on 7/26/2016[/B]

[B]Healzalot - 149[/B]
   --- Huge Healing - 100
   --- Pretty Big Healing - 49

[B]Healzalittle - 15[/B]
   --- Huge Healing - 10
   --- Pretty Big Healing - 5

[B]Produced by GamParse v1.5.1.6[/B]
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>[B]Combined: An enraged lemming on 7/26/2016[/B]

[B]Healzalot - 135[/B]
   --- Huge Healing - 85
   --- Pretty Big Healing - 50

[B]Healzalittle - 19[/B]
   --- Huge Healing - 15
   --- Pretty Big Healing - 4

[B]Produced by GamParse v1.5.1.6[/B]
</code></pre>

<p>you would end up with a table showing Healzalot having cast Huge Healing 100 times and Pretty Big Healing 50 times, with Healzalittle having cast them 15 and 5 times, respectively.</p>

<h3>
<a id="blacklisting-spells" class="anchor" href="#blacklisting-spells" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Blacklisting Spells</h3>

<p>Let's face it, not every spellcast that ends up in your log file is necessarily interesting. Does anyone care that a cleric cast Lesser Yaulp 342 times on last night's raid? Not likely. That's where the blacklist comes in.</p>

<p>Create a file named <code>blacklist.ini</code> in the directory with eqparsetables.py or direct EQParseTables to a custom blacklist using the <code>-b</code> switch followed by the path to your custom blacklist. Blacklisting a spell is then as simple as adding a line to that file containing only the name of the spell you want blacklisted. Don't worry about adding spell ranks to the end of the name; EQParseTables takes care of that for you. For instance, if you want to blacklist all ranks of Lesser Yaulp, just add the line</p>

<p><code>Lesser Yaulp</code></p>

<p>to your blacklist.ini! Since EQParseTables blacklists anything beginning with the spell names you type in, ignoring those annoying placeholder clickies and illusions is as easy as adding</p>

<pre><code>Shadow of
Illusion:
</code></pre>

<p>to the blacklist. Hooray!</p>

<h3>
<a id="player-config" class="anchor" href="#player-config" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Player Config</h3>

<p>Since GamParse summaries don't include players' classes, you'll need to set up a file called <code>config.ini</code> in your EQParseTables directory. This is what's known as a CSV (comma separated values) file, and adding a player is as easy as adding a line for each player containing his or her name, EQ class abbreviation, and nickname. For instance, if you have a druid with the ridiculously long and just plain ridiculous name Evilhealzforthewin, simply add this to your config.ini:</p>

<p><code>Evilhealzforthewin,DRU,Evil</code></p>

<p>This will allow EQParseTables to recognize your character in the parse summary and assign it to the proper table. It will also change your character's name to Evil in the table header so that things stay nice and tidy.</p>
